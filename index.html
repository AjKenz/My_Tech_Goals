            <h2>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
            <p>As an upcoming full-stack developer and frontend engineer, I have set several goals for myself over the
                next two years. These goals are designed to help me perfect my craft, learn new technologies, and become
                a flexible developer capable of working on a variety of projects within well-established organizations.
                Here’s what I’m aiming for:</p>
            <h3>1. Master Core Technologies</h3>
            <p>I aim to gain in-depth knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as achieve proficiency in React
                for frontend development and Node.js with Express for backend development. To do this, I will complete
                advanced tutorials, build projects, and contribute to open-source projects.</p>

            <h3>2. Learn and Implement New Technologies</h3>
            <p>It’s crucial to stay updated with modern web technologies like TypeScript, GraphQL, and WebAssembly. I
                also plan to explore frameworks and libraries such as Next.js, Redux, and Tailwind CSS by participating
                in courses, implementing them in projects, and following tech blogs.</p>

            <h3>3. Improve Full-Stack Development Skills</h3>
            <p>I will focus on understanding and applying database management with MongoDB and SQL, learning about
                serverless architecture, and developing scalable applications using cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or
                Google Cloud.</p>

            <h3>4. Focus on Responsive and Accessible Design</h3>
            <p>Ensuring all web projects are fully responsive and accessible is a top priority. I plan to follow
                responsive web design tutorials, test projects for accessibility, and stay updated with accessibility
                guidelines and tools.</p>

            <h3>5. Contribute to and Learn from the Developer Community</h3>
            <p>Being an active member of coding communities and forums is essential. I’ll participate in communities
                like GitHub and Stack Overflow, share knowledge through blogs or YouTube, and network with other
                developers for mentorship opportunities.</p>

            <h3>6. Gain Practical Experience Through Internships and Projects</h3>
            <p>I aim to gain real-world experience by working on internships and projects within well-established
                organizations. This involves applying for internships, collaborating with other developers, and seeking
                continuous feedback for improvement.</p>

            <h3>7. Diversify My Project Portfolio</h3>
            <p>Working on a variety of projects across different niches like e-commerce, fintech, and healthcare will
                help me develop a versatile portfolio. Each project will showcase unique skills or technologies to
                demonstrate my flexibility and expertise.</p>
